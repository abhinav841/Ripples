**The following sections explain the salient parts of the program.**
## func()
The first thing that takes sight is ```func()``` - the surface function.

Value (float) returned by func() is taken as the z-coordinate of the point (x, y) passed to func(), i.e., the height of that point above/below the x-y plane.
Hence, func() defines the surface that is mostly spread across the horizon. There is another variable t for time, making the surface dynamic w.r.t time.

As a sidenote, I have found only periodic functions enjoyable - trigonometric and functions involving modulo.

## main()
